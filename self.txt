Exam program notes:
Make unit class
Polymorphism unit class

At the start of each turn, call set-up inside each unit.
When ticking delay, call function in unit class so unit class can have unique delay effects
When taking/dealing damage, call functin in unit class so unit class can have unique attacks.
When checking unit count, call function in unit class.

When Attacking:
Get current power of Unit.
Check the bottom most unit on enemy side.
Deal damage to unit and reduce Power by that units Power.
Repeat.
If no unit on back tile: Deal power to enemy hp instead.

Split Tile and Unit. Unit controls sprite and stats, Tile controls whats on it for board based actions.


TODO IMPORTANT: REWORK COLORS. Save all unit data under each player, then use those to summon units. Remove unitdata from everywhere else. Refactor "Color" into a type of UnitID, so 2 units with the same unit number don't mix. This is cus each color is unique and no other unit can share the same color.
